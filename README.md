# readme_generator

Built by Michael Rao

A node.js application that takes input from the user to generate a README.md file in the application repository. The README file is then stored in ./files/README.md. A product demonstration video can be found here: ./src/READMEGeneratorDemonstration1080p.mov. A short gif of the product workflow can be seen here: ./src/readmeGenerator.gif.

# Technologies Used

# Description

This node application allows users respond to a series of questions, the answers to which are used to populate a professional and complete README.md file, which is then stored in the repository.

The README file contains a series of sections which contain data from the various user inputs. A Title is populated at the top of the page, which is then followed by an image of the license, surfaced based on the user's license selection. Below, a description section is populated with data input by the user. Next, a table of contents sections describes the other information that is made available in the README document. Each section in the ToC is clickable, taking the user to that section. Finally, a series of other sections will appear that surface data entered by the user. The last section called Questions shows links to the user's GitHub profile and email address.
